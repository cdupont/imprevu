- Move Time in Evaluation
- Better names for TestState, TestIO

- In Happstack: factorize tests, servers
- getIntermediateResults seems to leak some internals. Anyway do we really need it?
- fix export lists: should we expect from users to look into Imprevu?

- rename "events"
- Simplify "RuleEventInfo" ?

- Create master module "Imprevu.Happstack"

- factorize runEvalError/runEvaluate

- redundant withRN/withEvent, also evalEnv

Inputs:
- primitives in Inputs are quite numerous: suppress some?
- suppress Show from class constraints?
